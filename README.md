## Features

- Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division
- Clear entry functionality
- Intuitive and user-friendly interface

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `tkinter` library (comes pre-installed with Python)


## Code Overview

1. **Importing Necessary Libraries:**
   The script starts by importing the `tkinter` library, which is used to create the GUI.

2. **Creating the Main Window:**
   The main application window is initialized using `tkinter.Tk()` and configured with a title.

3. **Creating Entry Widget:**
   An entry widget is created using `tkinter.Entry()` to display the input and output.

4. **Defining Button Click Events:**
   Functions are defined to handle button click events, including digit input, clearing the entry, performing arithmetic operations, and evaluating expressions.

5. **Creating Buttons:**
   Buttons for digits (0-9) and operations (+, -, *, /, =, C) are created using `tkinter.Button()` and placed on the window.

6. **Running the Application:**
   The `mainloop()` method is used to run the application, displaying the calculator GUI.
